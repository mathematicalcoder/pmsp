      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Pisay Mathers Summer Program aims to help aspiring math olympians in PSHS prepare for the Philippine Mathematical Olympiad before the school year starts. The program will run from 17 June 2024 to 16 August 2024.</p>

      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>This is quite similar to Evan Chen’s OTIS program, except with some modifications to cater to the skills and needs of PSHS students from all grade levels.

This is a self-paced program, meaning students can work on the topics at their own time and pace, and there are no strict deadlines. Handouts and quizzes are accessible from June 17 to August 23 and students can work on and submit as many of them as they want during the time frame.

Each lesson has a difficulty level as shown below.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-1"><b>Level 1</b></div>
  <div class="col-3">PMO Qualifying level</div>
  <div class="col-1"><b>Level 2</b></div>
  <div class="col-3">PMO Area level</div>
  <div class="col-1"><b>Level 3</b></div>
  <div class="col-3">PMO National / IMO HM/Bronze level</div>
</div>
        
The problem sets given with each handout require a specific number of problems that must be solved based on the sum of the weights (expressed by a number followed by P) given to each problem. For example, a problem set may say: "Solve at least 30P. If you have time, solve at least 40P."
This means that the problem set requires students to solve problems that have weights that sum to 30P for them to complete the set.

Each topic also has a corresponding quiz. Most, if not all, quizzes are short 4- to 6-item, 45- to 60-minute quizzes on the current topic. The scores of the quizzes are averaged to get the student’s score for the summer program. Students may earn bonus points via Problem of the Day and submitting problem sets.

On July 17, August 19, and August 21, PMC (Pisay Mathers Contest; open to all people in the server) will be hosted.
